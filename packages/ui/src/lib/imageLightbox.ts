 * depending on any provider being above it in the tree (block views are
 * deliberately provider-free). The overlay component ({@link
 * components/ImageLightbox}) subscribes via {@link useImageLightbox}.
 *
 * Intentionally minimal: just the picture `src`, its `alt`, and the element that
 * opened it (so focus can return there on close). A later zoom/pan layer (LBX-2)
 * can extend this state without changing the open/close contract.
