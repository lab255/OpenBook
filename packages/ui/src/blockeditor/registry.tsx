 * keyed by block `type`, optionally with a slash-menu entry. The registry is
 * a module-level singleton — same pattern as the app's pageLinks bridge — so
 * registration works from any layer without threading React context.
 *
 * Custom blocks receive the raw block Y.Map and the editor controller; they
 * own their props via `blockProp`/`setBlockProp` (CRDT-synced like
 * everything else) and are rendered inside the standard row (gutter, drag,
 * selection all behave normally).

   * never persists), which means every block asking `editor.readOnly` sees
   * `false` on exactly the page where the answer matters. A widget that merely
   * moves a slider does not care; one that offers to WRITE somewhere else —
   * the ledger's "Correct this entry" is the first — has to be able to tell the
   * difference, or it advertises an action the reader cannot take.

   * Read it as "may this reader change the document?", not "is this widget
   * frozen?" — for the latter, `editor.readOnly` is still the right question.
