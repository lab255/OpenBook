/**
 * Suggestions + comments: a review layer over a page's content.
 *
 * A SUGGESTION is a proposed change to the document that is NOT applied
 * immediately — it is persisted, surfaced for review (inline in the document
 * and in a side-pane "Review" surface), and applied to the CRDT only when a
 * human accepts it. AI write tools and humans produce the SAME suggestion
 * model: the agent's write tools persist suggestions instead of mutating, and
 * a human "Suggest edit" affordance persists one too.
 *
 * A COMMENT is a general discussion layer: a threaded comment on a suggestion
 * (the suggestion's review thread) OR a standalone comment anchored to a block.
 * Comment bodies are rich text (`TextRun[]`, the same projection the block
 * editor uses), so they support bold/italic/underline/links.
 *
 * The `kind`/`payload` shape of a suggestion mirrors the agent's former
 * `AgentProposal` exactly, so the existing editor-bridge apply path
 * (CRDT-first, savePage fallback) replays a suggestion's `payload` unchanged.
 */

/**
 * One run of rich text in a comment body. Structurally identical to the block
 * editor's `TextRun` (a string plus optional inline attributes), defined here
 * so the SDK stays free of any UI dependency. The UI's `TextRun` is assignable
 * to this, and vice-versa.
