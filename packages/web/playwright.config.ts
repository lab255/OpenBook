/**
 * Playwright e2e for the web shell. Playwright manages one Next.js dev server
 * (:3000); each WORKER spawns its own OpenBook data server (ports 4400+, a
 * throwaway data dir each — see e2e/fixtures.ts) and points its browser
 * contexts at it via the `openbook.serverUrl` override the web shell honours.
 * Disjoint workspaces per worker are what make parallel spec files safe: page
 * names are unique per workspace, so the old shared-server setup forced
 * `workers: 1` and a fully serial suite.
 *
 * Prerequisite: the workspace libs must be built (`pnpm build:libs`) — Next dev
 * and the tsx servers both resolve `@book.dev/{ui,sdk}` from their dist. CI
 * restores the shared built-libs cache in each browser job and runs
 * `pnpm build:libs` on a cache miss before starting Playwright.
 *
 * Visual diffs: archiving is decoupled from functional runs (OB-222). Tests
 * import from `e2e/fixtures`, which only extends `@chromatic-com/playwright`
 * (and archives the DOM) when `CHROMATIC_ARCHIVE=1`; otherwise it's plain
 * `@playwright/test`. `pnpm chromatic` sets that flag, archives just the
 * `@visual` specs, then uploads (needs CHROMATIC_PROJECT_TOKEN).
