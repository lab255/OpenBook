# OpenBook desktop app

`@book.dev/app` is the Tauri desktop shell for the OpenBook React UI.
From the workspace root, run it with `pnpm tauri dev`.
Create a desktop build with `pnpm build:desktop`.

## Sidecar supervision verification

The bundled sidecar is supervised only in a release build (`tauri dev` uses the
external development server), so verify BOOT-4 against the uninstalled release
app:

1. From the repository root, run `pnpm install --frozen-lockfile`, then
   `pnpm build:desktop`.
2. Quit any installed OpenBook instance. In a terminal, launch
   `packages/app/src-tauri/target/release/bundle/macos/OpenBook.app/Contents/MacOS/OpenBook`
   and keep its stderr visible. On Linux/Windows use the corresponding unpacked
   release executable.
3. Open a page and make an edit. In a second terminal, identify the child whose
   command starts with `openbook-server` using
   `ps -axo pid=,ppid=,command= | rg openbook-server`; confirm its PPID is the
   OpenBook host PID, then run `kill -9 <sidecar-pid>`.
4. The host log must show `state: Respawning, attempts: 1` and, after about one
   second, `state: Running, attempts: 1`. Re-run the `ps` command and confirm the
   sidecar has a new PID. Reload the page, make another edit, and confirm it saves
   without restarting the app.
5. Open **Settings → Sharing**, change the library access setting, reload, and
   confirm the change persisted. This is an owner-gated server mutation and
   verifies that the app-run `OPENBOOK_LOCAL_OWNER_SECRET` still authenticates
   after the process respawn.
6. Trigger a deliberate restart by toggling **Settings → Publish on LAN** or by
   changing the book directory. The old generation may log an
   `expected/stale termination`, but the next surfaced state must be
   `Running, attempts: 0`; it must not schedule an automatic backoff.

The webview contract can be sampled with Tauri `invoke('sidecar_state')`, and a
repair action calls `invoke('restart_sidecar')`. Both that query and every
`sidecar-state` event use this payload:

```ts
{
  state: 'dead' | 'respawning' | 'running';
  attempts: number;
  lastExitCode: number | null;
  lastStderrTail: string[];
  socketReady: boolean;
}
```

`state: 'running'` continues to mean that the process was spawned;
`socketReady` becomes true only after the current generation accepts a host
socket connection. Existing fields and meanings are unchanged. Automatic
socket/process failures share the five-attempt budget. A deliberate repair via
`restart_sidecar` invalidates the prior generation and resets `attempts` to zero,
including when the prior state was `dead`, so the manual repair is always allowed
a fresh bounded run.

Crash-loop exhaustion, the 1/2/4/8/16-second bound, healthy reset, deliberate
stop suppression, and repair reset are deterministic unit tests in
`src-tauri/src/sidecar_supervision.rs` (`cargo test sidecar_supervision`).

## Meeting microphone manual checks

1. Launch the desktop app, open a saved page, type `/meeting`, and select
   **Meeting**. Click **Record** and accept the OS microphone permission prompt.
   On macOS, check **System Settings → Privacy & Security → Microphone** if the
   prompt was previously denied; reopen OpenBook after changing permission.
2. Speak, pause, and confirm a playable audio chunk appears. Resume, speak again,
   then stop. Confirm both chunks play and the elapsed time excludes the pause.
3. With a supported transcription backend configured, confirm transcript lines
   appear as chunks complete. If no backend is available, confirm audio and notes
   remain usable and transcription offers retry. See
   [local transcription setup](../../docs/local-transcription.md) for the current
   local-engine integration limitation.
4. Generate a summary, cancel a regeneration, and confirm the previous summary
   survives. Type a manual note. Export audio and Markdown; check the ZIP's
   individual recordings and the Markdown transcript, summary, and note.
5. Revoke microphone access and reopen the app. Attempt recording: confirm a
   permission error appears, Stop stays disabled, and manual notes still work.

These checks require the actual desktop webview and OS permission system. The
web e2e's oscillator stream does not validate desktop entitlements or hardware.
