 * (role, effective visibility, ACL) lives on {@link PageStore}. This module is the

 *
 *  - {@link requireAccess} / {@link requireDbAccess} / {@link requireCreate} —
 *    the central default-deny gate every content route calls. `!canRead` ⇒ 404
 *    (hide existence), a writer-only need with `!canWrite` ⇒ 403.
 *  - {@link streamGates} — per-subscriber {@link EventGate}s for the live channels,
 *    so the `PageHub` fan-out filters unreadable pages/rows per subscriber and the
 *    library-wide firehose also excludes undiscoverable page content (S4 / UP-2).
