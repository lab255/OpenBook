# Development

## Prerequisites

- Node.js `^22.14.0 || >=24.10.0`. `.nvmrc` pins Node 24.
- [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/installation). The repository pins the version.
- Bun `1.3.14` for the server sidecar.
- A [Rust toolchain](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install) for the desktop app.

## Setup

```sh
corepack enable
pnpm install
pnpm dev
```

`pnpm dev` starts the SDK, server, UI, web, and desktop development loops.
`pnpm build` is a full production build.

## Storage and server

OpenBook stores documents as pages: a UUID, an optional name, and JSON data in
Postgres. The desktop and headless deployments use the same TypeScript server.
The desktop bundles it as a Bun sidecar with embedded PGlite. Headless
deployments use external Postgres.

The web app, desktop app, and server share types and the HTTP client through
[`@book.dev/sdk`](packages/sdk/README.md).

- [`packages/sdk`](packages/sdk/README.md): shared types and `HttpDataClient`.
- [`packages/server`](packages/server/README.md): Hono API and page store for
  embedded or external Postgres.

Run the headless server:

```sh
OPENBOOK_DATABASE_URL=postgres://user:pass@host:5432/openbook \
  pnpm --filter @book.dev/server dev
```

Without `OPENBOOK_DATABASE_URL`, the development server uses embedded PGlite.

### able OIDC sign-in delegation

Set both `ABLE_OAUTH_CLIENT_ID` and `ABLE_OAUTH_CLIENT_SECRET` on the server to
replace the default account-service sign-in entry point with the server-side
able OAuth 2.1/OIDC flow. If either value is absent, the two able auth routes are
not mounted. The confidential-client secret remains server-only and is never
returned through the settings/API surface.

The production issuer defaults to `https://account.able.online/api/auth`.
Self-hosted and test deployments may override it with `ABLE_OAUTH_ISSUER`, and
may independently set `ABLE_OAUTH_DISCOVERY_URL`. The registered local callback
is `http://localhost:4319/api/auth/oauth2/callback/able`.

For local development, keep credentials in the git-ignored `.env.able.local`
file and load it into the server process; never add that file to a commit.
